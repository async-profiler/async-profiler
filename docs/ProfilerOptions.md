# Profiler Options

The below table lists the profiler options available with `asprof` and also when
[launching as an agent](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler/blob/master/docs/OtherUseCases.md#launching-as-an-agent).
Most of the options are identical and will be mentioned under `asprof` column with a `-` in the
`Launch as agent` column. Only if an option is different for `Launch as agent`, it will be
explicitly mentioned. The third column is for the description of the option which will always be
same for both.

## Appendix

### Event Option

In allocation profiling mode the top frame of every call trace is the class
of the allocated object, and the counter is the heap pressure (the total size
of allocated TLABs or objects outside TLAB).

In lock profiling mode the top frame is the class of lock/monitor, and
the counter is number of nanoseconds it took to enter this lock/monitor.

Two special event types are supported on Linux: hardware breakpoints
and kernel tracepoints:
- `-e mem:<func>[:rwx]` sets read/write/exec breakpoint at function
  `<func>`. The format of `mem` event is the same as in `perf-record`.
  Execution breakpoints can be also specified by the function name,
  e.g. `-e malloc` will trace all calls of native `malloc` function.
- `-e trace:<id>` sets a kernel tracepoint. It is possible to specify
  tracepoint symbolic name, e.g. `-e syscalls:sys_enter_open` will trace
  all `open` syscalls.

### Dump Option
`-o fmt` - specifies what information to dump when profiling ends.
`fmt` can be one of the following options:
- `traces[=N]` - dump call traces (at most N samples);
- `flat[=N]` - dump flat profile (top N hot methods);  
  can be combined with `traces`, e.g. `traces=200,flat=200`
- `jfr` - dump events in Java Flight Recorder format readable by Java Mission Control.
  This *does not* require JDK commercial features to be enabled.
- `collapsed` - dump collapsed call traces in the format used by
  [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) script. This is
  a collection of call stacks, where each line is a semicolon separated list
  of frames followed by a counter.
- `flamegraph` - produce Flame Graph in HTML format.
- `tree` - produce Call Tree in HTML format.  
  `--reverse` option will generate backtrace view.

It is possible to specify multiple dump options at the same time.
