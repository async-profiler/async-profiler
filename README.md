# async-profiler

This project is a proof-of-concept implementation of a Java profiler that
features the HotSpot-specific `AsyncGetCallTrace` API for Java call stacks,
combined with `perf_events` for native call stacks. The general approach is
receiving call stacks generated by `perf_events` and matching them up with
call stacks generated by `AsyncGetCallTrace`, in order to produce an accurate
profile of both Java and native code, including kernel frames.

This approach has the following advantages compared to using `perf_events`
directly with a Java agent that translates addresses to Java method names:

* Works on older Java versions because it doesn't require
`-XX:+PreserveFramePointer`, which is only available in Java 1.8u60 and later.

* Does not introduce the performance overhead from `-XX:+PreserveFramePointer`,
which can in rare cases be as high as 10%.

* Does not require generating a map file to map Java code addresses to method
names.

* Works with interpreter frames.

* Does not require writing out a perf.data file for further processing in
user space scripts.

Because of the requirement for `perf_events`, this tool works only on Linux
platforms. Additionally, on some Linux versions, two runtime variables need to
be tuned in order to allow non-root users to use `perf_events`.

## Building

Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler)

Make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your JDK installation,
and then run `make`. GCC is required. After building, the profiler agent binary
will be in the `build` subdirectory. Additionally, a small Java application
that can load the agent into the target process will also be compiled to the
`build` subdirectory.

## Basic Usage

As of Linux 4.6, capturing kernel call stacks using `perf_events` from a non-
root process requires setting two runtime variables. You can set them using
sysctl or as follows:

```
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
```

To run the agent and pass commands to it, the helper script `profiler.sh`
is provided. A typical workflow would be to launch your Java application,
attach the agent and start profiling, exercise your performance scenario, and
then stop profiling. The agent's output, including the profiling results, will
be displayed in the Java application's standard output.

Example:

```
$ jps
9234 Jps
8983 Computey
$ ./profiler.sh start 8983
$ ./profiler.sh stop 8983
```

Alternatively, you may specify `-d` (duration) argument to profile
the application for a fixed period of time with a single command.

```
$ ./profiler.sh -d 30 8983
```

By default, the profiling frequency is 1000Hz (every 1ms of CPU time).
Here is a sample of the output printed to the Java application's terminal:

```
--- Execution profile ---
Total:                   687
Unknown (native):        1 (0.15%)

Samples: 679 (98.84%)
    [ 0] Primes.isPrime
    [ 1] Primes.primesThread
    [ 2] Primes.access$000
    [ 3] Primes$1.run
    [ 4] java.lang.Thread.run

... a lot of output omitted for brevity ...

         679 (98.84%) Primes.isPrime
           4 (0.58%)  __do_softirq

... more output omitted ...
```

This indicates that the hottest method was `Primes.isPrime`, and the hottest
call stack leading to it comes from `Primes.primesThread`.

## Generating Flame Graphs

To generate flame graphs or other visualizations from the collected profiling
information, you will need to dump the raw collected traces to a file and then
post-process it. The following example uses Brendan Gregg's
[FlameGraph](https://github.com/BrendanGregg/FlameGraph) scripts, but a similar
solution can be tailored to other visualization tools.

```
$ jps
9234 Jps
8983 Computey
$ ./profiler.sh -d 30 -o flamegraph -f /tmp/traces.txt 8983
$ FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl --colors=java /tmp/traces.txt > /tmp/flamegraph.svg
```

## Profiler Options

The following is a complete list of the command-line options accepted by
`profiler.sh` script.

* `start` - starts profiling in semi-automatic mode, i.e. profiler will run
until `stop` command is explicitly called.

* `stop` - stops profiling and prints the report.

* `status` - prints profiling status: whether profiler is active and
for how long.

* `-d N` - the profiling duration, in seconds. If no `start`, `stop`
or `status` option is given, the profiler will run for the specified period
of time and then automatically stop.  
Example: `./profiler.sh -d 30 8983`

* `-i N` - sets the profiling interval, in nanoseconds. Only CPU active time
is counted. No samples are collected while CPU is idle. The default is
1000000 (1ms).  
Example: `./profiler.sh -i 100000 8983`

* `-b N` - sets the frame buffer size, in the number of Java
method ids that should fit in the buffer. If you receive messages about an
insufficient frame buffer size, increase this value from the default.  
Example: `./profiler.sh -b 5000000 8983`

* `-o fmt[,fmt...]` - specifies what information to dump when profiling ends.
This is a comma-separated list of the following options:
  - `summary` - dump basic profiling statistics;
  - `traces[=N]` - dump call traces (at most N samples);
  - `methods[=N]` - dump hot methods (at most N samples);
  - `flamegraph` - dump raw call traces in the format used by
  [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) script. This is
  a collection of call stacks, where each line is a semicolon separated list
  of frames followed by the sample count. For example:
  ```
  java/lang/Thread.run;Primes$1.run;Primes.access$000;Primes.primesThread;Primes.isPrime 1056
  ```
  The default format is `summary,traces=200,methods=200`.

* `-f FILENAME` - the file name to dump the profile information to.  
Example: `./profiler.sh -o flamegraph -f /tmp/traces.txt 8983`

## Restrictions/Limitations

* On most Linux systems, `perf_events` captures call stacks with a maximum depth
of 127 frames. On recent Linux kernels, this can be configured using
`sysctl kernel.perf_event_max_stack` or by writing to the
`/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack` file.

* Profiler allocates 8kB perf_event buffer for each thread of the target process.
Make sure `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb` value is large enough
(more than `8 * threads`) when running under unprivileged user.
Otherwise the message _"perf_event mmap failed: Operation not permitted"_
will be printed, and no native stack traces will be collected.

* There is no bullet-proof guarantee that the `perf_events` overflow signal
is delivered to the Java thread in a way that guarantees no other code has run,
which means that in some rare cases, the captured Java stack might not match
the captured native (user+kernel) stack.

*  You will not see the non-Java frames _preceding_ the Java frames on the
stack. For example, if `start_thread` called `JavaMain` and then your Java
code started running, you will not see the first two frames in the resulting
stack. On the other hand, you _will_ see non-Java frames (user and kernel)
invoked by your Java code.
